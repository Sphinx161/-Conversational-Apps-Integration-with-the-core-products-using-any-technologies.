The Voiceflow App allows only the Google account sign in we used while creating the project, thus providing high security and full access to the Manager (referring to the Manager-Employee domain we chose). The Manager will be able to access the database created in Airtable only when he/she is signed into the google account. This Google assistant integration is able to fetch details and update the details of the employees succesfully. 
Tech used: Voiceflow, Airtable, Dialogflow, and Google Assistant.
